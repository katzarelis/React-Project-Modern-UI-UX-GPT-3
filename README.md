- **File and Folder Structure:** Delved into best practices for organizing React project files and folders, promoting maintainability and scalability.

- **CSS Mastery with Flex & Grid:** Acquired a solid understanding of fundamental CSS properties, particularly flexbox and grid, enabling more efficient and responsive layouts.

- **CSS BEM Model:** Learned and implemented the Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) methodology for styling, fostering a modular and maintainable CSS codebase.

- **Animations and Gradients:** Explored the creation of soft and pleasant animations along with the implementation of complex gradients, enhancing the visual appeal of the website.

- **Responsive Design with Media Queries:** Mastered the art of perfectly placed media queries to ensure satisfactory responsiveness across a wide range of devices.
